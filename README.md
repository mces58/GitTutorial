:bulb:**Before diving into Git usage, let's take a look at some essential terminal commands.**

#### Here are some basic terminal commands:

- `ls`: It lists the files and folders in the current directory.

- `ls -la`: It lists the files and folders in the current directory in detail, showing permissions, owners, and other attributes of the files.

- `cd [directory]`: It changes the directory to the specified one.

- `cd ..`: It allows the user to move up one directory level from the current directory, effectively navigating to the parent directory.

- `mkdir [folder name]`: It creates a new folder.

- `rmdir`: It is used to delete the specified folder (directory). However, the folder must be empty. If there are files or subfolders inside the folder, the `rmdir` command will not work. If files or subfolders need to be deleted as well, the `rm -rf` command should be used.

- `touch [file name]`: It creates a new file.

- `rm [file name]`: It deletes the specified file.

- `cp [source] [destination]`: It copies the source file to the destination location.

- `mv [source] [destination]`: It moves the source file to the destination location.

- `cat [file name]`: It prints the content of the file to the terminal.

- `grep [word] [file name]`: It finds the lines containing the specified word.

- `chmod [permissions] [file name]`: It changes the permissions of the file.

- `pwd`: It shows the current working directory. You can use this command to find out in which directory you are located.

- `echo 'message' > [file name]`: Writes a "message" containing text or a string of characters to the specified file.

- `nano [file name]`: Used to open and edit a file.

##### These commands will suffice for basic terminal usage.
